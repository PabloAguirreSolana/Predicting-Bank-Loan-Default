# Predicting-Bank-Loan-Default
Several Machine Learning Techniques are employed in this project to correclt classify which users of a Bank can default or not.

A total of 10 models were made with different techniques (LDA, QDA, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest) to have the best prediction of eligibility and defaulting for our business problem.

All these different techniques present trade-offs: some perform better in predicting one class and others are better in predicting the other class . This depends mainly in the weight of the class in the parameters of the models, which was crucial for the final model selected.

The selection of our final model, was made based on the highest Precision and Accuracy, which is most relevant in terms of revenue.
